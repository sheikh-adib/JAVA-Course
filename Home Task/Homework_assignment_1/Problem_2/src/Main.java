/*
The diameter of the Sun is approximately 865,000 miles. The diameter of the Earth is
approximately 7600 miles. Use the methods in the class Math to calculate,
(a) the volume of the Earth in cubic miles
(b) the volume of the Sun in cubic miles
(c) the ratio of the volume of the Sun to the volume of the Earth
and then output the three values. Treat both the earth and sun as spheres. The volume of a
sphere is given by the formula 4 pi r^3/3 where r is the radius.
Run the code you have written, and turn in both your code and the output of the program. The
output should say something like: The volume of the Earth is X cubic miles, the volume of the
sun is Y cubic miles, and the ratio of the volume of the Sun to the volume of the Earth is Z.
